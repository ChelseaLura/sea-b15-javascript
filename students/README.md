# Create a folder with your name here!

Send a Pull Request with your own folder.

Inside your folder should be a single readme.md file that contains some basic info about you. You should include your GitHub username, linked to your GitHub profile. Also link to your Twitter account, your LinkedIn page, and any other relvant information or online presence you'd like to share with your classmates.

I have created an example folder.
